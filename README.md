# 2020-ca400-collim38-ejikei2

This repo is a clone of my original final year project repo.
The project was completed by myself and my partner.

We used MongoDB for the database due to its noSQL nature and its effortless integration with the rest of the stack.
Node.js was used for the server, along with Express JS for the API. React was used for the frontend.

My part in this project was focusing on the database, server, and API. The implementation can be found in "src/backend/main", as well as the test cases in "src/backend/test". The backend tests had 98% coverage.

The techincal specification, as well as all other documents, can be found in "docs". The documentation for the API can be found in "docs/documentation/index.html".
